# Welcome to EmotionAnalyzer!

## Instructions:
- This project (Emotion_Analyzer.ipynb) is designed to run on Google Colab
  
- Recommended Runtime: T4-GPU
  
- Run the code up to "Load the model into Huggingface"
   - The Model is designed so that you can run your own model instance on the Hugginface page.
     For this, you will need a Huggingface account. The output at the bottom of the code will provide a link to the model
   - If you do not wish to create an account, you can use my version here: https://huggingface.co/Chorzy/EmotionAnalyzer

- To evaluate the performance, I used images from the example datasets found in this repository (Happy Humans and Happy_dogs).

- Load the images to the model and copy the predicted result for the correct Emotion, then paste it in the "Evaluating the Results" chapter of the notebook
- If you do not wish to do this manually, you can use the numbers that should already be input in the notebook. If this is not the case, you can copy them from the "Accuracy.txt"
